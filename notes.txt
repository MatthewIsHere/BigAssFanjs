as far as i know, it works on nodejs 14.0.0 and later and not earlier because of the private classes.
i will try to make it work on 11.0.0 so that Raspberry Pi Zeroes can use this library.
(NodeJS only supported ARM v6l until 11.0.0 which is the architecture of the RPI 0)


Test and fill out all propertygroups

Examples

Add an all fans controller entry. should be pretty easy, but can't decide where to put it in the class.

Plan to search for fans multiple times because of overlap

maybe end up removing property groups and merge getters and setter onto BigAssFan Class
